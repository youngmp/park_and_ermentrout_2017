Figure generation code for Park and Ermentrout 2017

"Scalar reduction of a neural field model with spike frequency adaptation"

Submitted to SIADS

One of the figure data files is 600MB, so I've uploaded it to my google drive folder https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B9sbhhWZNphmN1QwaXZHbVhhTW8

The last figure of the paper uses this data to generate the figure.
